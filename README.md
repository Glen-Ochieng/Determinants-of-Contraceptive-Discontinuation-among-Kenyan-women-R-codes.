# My-Fourth-Year-Project-
For my fourth year project, I together with three of my classmates used some of the codes in this reposirtory. The project was Contraceptive Discontinuation among Kenyan women: A Survival Analysis Study.

***Assumptions for this study were as follows*
1. Each partcipant was assumed to be using one contraceptive at a time.
2. Once a participant discontinued the contraceptive they were on, they were regarded as censored.  

##1. Event histogram 
We choose a histogram to demonstrate the concentration of the variable of interest- time to contraceptive discontinuation. The visual answers the question, "At each study month how many women discontinued the particular contraceptive they had?"
